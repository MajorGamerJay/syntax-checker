# syntax-checker
K&amp;R's "The C Programming Language" solution to exercise 1.24, since this is something very big, I thought I might as well make a repository for it.

Checks for Syntax errors (unmatched brackets and other things) and displays them on STDOUT, program should be piped in for input.

Uses <stdio.h> only and no structs or dynamic data structures. Only arrays.

Has an anomaly/unpredictable behavior which is listed in the code, please check and tell me if this could be solved.

Saving this repository so that once I am done with finishing the book, I will make a good and better version of it.
